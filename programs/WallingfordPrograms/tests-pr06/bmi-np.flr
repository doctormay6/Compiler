  This program computes a person's body mass index.  Inputs are
  the person's height in feet and inches and the person's height
  in pounds.  The height and weight are converted to meters and
  kilograms, respectively.  The computation typically uses one
  significant digit after the decimal point, so I multiply the
  weight by 100, divide the BMI value by 10, and then use 10x
  the usual numbers for the category boindaries.

  Ordinarily, we would have a function to compute the BMI and
  a function to classify the BMI using an integer code:
     0   underweight
     1   normal
     2   overweight
     3   obese
  But without functions, I just return the BMI.

program main();
begin
  return
     1000 * 453592 * 160 / 10000           { 160 pounds }
   * 100                                   { divisor's denominator }
   * 100                                   {           squared     }
   / 254 / 12 / 6                          { divisor's numerator   }
   / 254 / 12 / 6                          { 6'0'      squared     }
end.
